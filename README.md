# rbxBanAsyncWiper
Extremely simple and lighweight BanAsync alt-association wiper for Roblox.
It is not guaranteed that this will always work/continue to work in the future.


:warning: **MAKE SURE YOU CLEAR YOUR ROBLOX COOKIES IN YOUR BROWSER BEFORE YOU LOG INTO YOUR ALT IF THE "ADD ACCOUNT" BUTTON APPEARS, IF YOU USE THE BUILT-IN ROBLOX ALT MANAGER IT WILL DETECT YOUR ALT** :warning: 
(I recommend using the roseal extension @www.roseal.live for account management, it allows you to add many more accounts at once and isn't affected by BanAsync account association.)

# Usage:
### Run this before joining a game you're banned from on an alt account.
### This will not clear bans if you've already been flagged as an alt account.
